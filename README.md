# Generative Decay
(renamed from Almost Void World)

Inspired by RaysGrid, this is a mod that adds several distinct ways to modify terrain

Source of inspiration:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdYABpmVwKg

I made the mod since the original RaysGrid mod isn't available to the public.
For something similar to RaysGrid, the distance3 setting is what you are looking for.
There are other options as well that are documented in the CurseForge page:https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/almost-void-world

## TODO
- Forge port
    - Not sure what the best way to do this is. loader-specific wrappers for common code?
- actual settings screen
- Add ability to create a custom expression or code instead of a predefined set of options
- make exceptions configurable on a per-world basis
